# BTP Solution Diagram starter kits

Welcome to the single source of truth for BTP Architects. The repository includes latest updates and ready-to-use templates. To get started as easy as possible you will find here all necessarry files and links to get started to build & create your first BTP Solution Diagram.
In detail you will find here:

- [Draw.io libraries](/assets/shape-libraries-and-editable-presets/draw.io/)
- [Draw.io reusable examples](/assets/editable-diagram-examples/)
- [BTP Solution Diagram design guidline](https://sap.github.io/btp-solution-diagrams/docs/solution_diagr_intro/big_picture/)

> **Tip:** Not all tools can display draw.io files, but there's no need to keep two versions of a solution diagramâ€”one as a draw.io file and another as a PNG file. Just export the diagram as a PNG (or SVG) image, including a copy, to enable continued editing via draw.io. For additional details, check the FAQ section of draw.io: [Export a diagram to a PNG image](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/export-to-png).
