# Product Names

*You will find the associated draw.io library in the  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SAP/btp-solution-diagrams/tree/main/assets/shape-libraries-and-editable-presets/draw.io)*

## SAP Branded Elements

SAP product names must be paired with the SAP logo.
It is not recommended to use too many SAP logos in the same diagram. Use text only elements instead.
