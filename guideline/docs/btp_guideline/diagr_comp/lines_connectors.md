# Connectors

*You will find the associated draw.io library in the  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SAP/btp-solution-diagrams/tree/main/assets/shape-libraries-and-editable-presets/draw.io)*

Connectors are non-, one- or bidirectional arrows.
For line style meaning please check the Foundation.

## Connector types


:::tip Data Flow
**The standard connectors are:**

**one-directional** data flows typically represent a request-response from client to server. 

**Bidirectional** solid arrows may represent mutual trust.

Use **semantic colors** to differentiate and add specific meaning to flows.

Use **accent** colors to highlight paths or flows which are not semantic.
